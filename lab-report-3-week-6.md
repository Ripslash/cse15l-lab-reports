Option 3!

Show copying your whole markdown-parse directory to your ieng6 account (-r, right?)
Show logging into your ieng6 account after doing this and compiling and running the tests for your repository (easy)
Show (like in the last step of the first lab) combining scp, ;, and ssh to copy the whole directory and run the tests in one line. (no fuckin idea)
