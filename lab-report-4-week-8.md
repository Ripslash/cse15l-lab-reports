## Lab Report 4

[This](https://github.com/Ripslash/markdown-parse) is my repo, and 
[this](https://github.com/BenX-64/markdown-parse)
is the repo of the guy that we worked with

### So
Both pieces of code failed the tests. It's a tragedy, but it happens.

I created the coding tests with this

What a shocker, and a tragedy.

I'm supposed to show a picture of the code failing, so 

Here's my code failing

## Fixes?

* Code Snippet One
    
    Well, this isn't a problem solvable in > 10 lines. The thing is, it's a group of multiple problems at the same time. The ` symbol has to be counted during the brackets, but not the parenthesis. Combine the with the counting brackets code, and then the two combined, it would take a medium amount of code

* Code Snippet Two

    Similarly to the first snippet, this is a combination of a group of issues that makes it longer than 10 lines. Firstly, the issue of nested links is super complex. Do you always take the deepest link? What if they're empty brackets but have a parenthesis? That in itself is a complex problem, but adding on nested parenthesis and escaped brackets makes it very difficult, this'll take a lot of code

* Code Snippet Three

    Honestly I feel like this one is really simple. It takes a few lines to write an if statement or two checking for a newline character before the final ']' and ')', easy peasy
